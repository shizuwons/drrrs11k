                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p class="c0">San Beda College Alabang accommodates a diverse community, spanning from young learners to graduate students. However, the presence of elementary and high school students, ages ranging from 5 to 18, poses a significant vulnerability in the face of potential disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Beyond demographic factors, the school's proximity to Taal Volcano, just 40.4 kilometers away, heightens the risk of adverse effects from volcanic activity. Additionally, its location along the West Valley Fault, notorious for producing powerful earthquakes, raises concerns, especially considering the fault's historical movement. West Valley Fault has an estimated 400-year recurrence interval. Its last known movement occurred in 1658, which is 358 years ago, raising the possibility that the area is overdue for another significant seismic event. Another concern is the aging infrastructure of certain buildings, notably the St. Scholastica building. This structure, housing hundreds of grade 11 students, exhibits signs of deterioration, including cracks in the ceilings, compromising student safety. To address these concerns and foster preparedness, we've developed this website, offering assessments, readiness strategies, and post-disaster support for the San Beda College Alabang community.</p>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c1">Significance: </span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because of its proximity to the active Taal Volcano and location along the West Valley Fault, San Beda College Alabang is extremely vulnerable to disasters, especially earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. For this reason, developing a preparedness plan is important. A preparedness plan will provide people with specific information and guidance, empowering them to effectively respond when disasters strike</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This plan not only provides guidance but also includes thorough assessments, predicting potential impacts on infrastructure and inhabitants. This prediction enables students and staff to prepare proactively, tailoring their responses based on the expected severity of the situation.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, the preparedness plan enables the creation of adaptable evacuation strategies. By implementing a comprehensive approach, SBCA can effectively mitigate risks and ensure a coordinated response, fostering resilience within the community amidst crisis.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In essence, the creation of a strong preparedness plan is crucial for San Beda College Alabang, as it not only enhances readiness but also supports the safety and well-being of all stakeholders in the face of unavoidable natural disasters.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c1">Role of technology: </span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Preparedness is very important for schools like San Beda College Alabang which is located near a volcano and along a fault line, as they face unique risks from potential volcanic eruptions and seismic events. These can pose significant risks to the safety and well-being of students, teachers, and staff. Therefore, SBCA must implement comprehensive preparedness measures to mitigate these risks effectively.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the measures San Beda College Alabang can take is the use of technology. Technology plays a key role in enhancing preparedness actions by utilizing advanced monitoring systems, delivering early warning systems, and facilitating coordination and collaboration. </span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Utilization of Advanced Monitoring Technologies:</span></p>

        <div id="earth" class="tabcontent content">
            <p class="c0">An earthquake is a rapid, intense shaking of the Earth's crust brought on by the movement of tectonic plates. It can cause a variety of effects, ranging from mild tremors to strong ground shaking, structural damage, and perhaps disastrous outcomes like landslides, tsunamis, and property and human loss. In the event of an earthquake, San Beda College Alabang could face significant impacts on its infrastructure, population, and critical facilities:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <img src="images/house.jpg" width="70%" style="float:left; margin-right:20px;"/>
            <p class="c0">• <b>Infrastructure Damage:</b> Given the aging infrastructure and signs of deterioration in buildings like the St. Scholastica building, there is a high risk of structural damage during an earthquake. Cracks in ceilings could worsen, leading to potential collapse or further structural compromise, endangering the safety of students and faculty.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="c0">• <b>Population:</b> The population of SBCA is more than a thousand. This means that in the event of an earthquake, the impacts will be more severe. Students, teachers, and staff face the risk of injury or death from falling debris or structural collapse within crowded school buildings. The traumatic experience can lead to fear, anxiety, and PTSD, especially affecting children's vulnerability and worsening emotional distress within the school community. Additionally, students may become separated from their caregivers or family, adding to the confusion and distress. Reuniting families after the disaster can be challenging, particularly if communication and transportation systems are disrupted.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="c0">• <b>Critical Facilities Impact:</b> The functionality of critical facilities, such as classrooms, laboratories, and administrative buildings, could be severely affected by infrastructure damage. Disruption to these facilities may slow down the continuation of academic activities and administrative functions, affecting the overall operation of the school.</p>

Post-disaster recovery and support refers to the techniques and resources used to rebuild, restore, and assist communities, individuals, and infrastructure that have been harmed by a natural or man-made disaster. It involves an extensive plan created to facilitate recovery from a disaster and a return to normal. After a disaster, life preservation, reestablishing livelihoods, and community reconstruction depend heavily on the post-disaster recovery and support plan of the community.</span></p>

            <p class="c0">The proposal advocates for the widespread adoption of trauma-informed treatment approaches that fundamentally acknowledge and address the profound, lasting effects that traumatic experiences can have on individuals and entire communities. For patients suffering from severe psychological distress, it is imperative that counseling and treatment prioritize exploring and processing any underlying trauma they may have endured. Counselors and therapists should be well-versed in trauma-responsive care that creates a safe, supportive environment for patients to confront and heal from their traumatic histories.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="c0">Furthermore, the proposal calls for actively promoting and facilitating the creation of community-based support groups. These groups would serve as essential platforms for those who have experienced trauma to openly share their emotions, recount their past traumatic experiences if they choose, and exchange coping strategies with others on a similar journey. The power of these support groups lies in fostering a profound sense of community, understanding, and fellowship among members - helping to minimize the alienation, disconnection and loneliness that trauma can often engender.</p>  
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="c0">By integrating trauma-informed care at the clinical level alongside community-based support systems, this multi-pronged approach aims to holistically validate, understand and aid in resolving trauma's insidious psychological impacts. Collectively acknowledging trauma's influence, both for individuals and communities, is a crucial first step in enabling recovery, resilience and healing.</p>
